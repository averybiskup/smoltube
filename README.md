### IDEA  

smol version of youtube where the only videos that show up are from the people
you subscribe too, and only the recent ones you haven't seen.  

the idea is to scroll less, and waste less time watching youtube videos because
you know what to watch and don't need to find something  

this idea comes from a rule in the book Atomic Habits, which says whenever you
do something like watch netflix, you should always know what to watch before
sitting down in order to spend less time trying to find something
